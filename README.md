# C-Program

Small programs to practice programming in C and Reverse Engineering

**pierrefeuilleciseaux.c** => Rock-Paper-Scissors game (in terminal)

**compare_hash.c** => compare two SHA512 strings    
One of the goals of this project is not to use string.h, strcmp(), or any other similar helper functions.

**convertisseur_time.c** => convert hours to years/months/days/hours remaining      
Personal project for my own use

**4pin_bruteforce.c** => needed to solve a challenge in a CTF

**decrypt_caesar.c** => decrypt caesar cipher for CTF

**bonjour.c** => Hello World without printf() but with <unistd.h>

**affa.c** => print the letter 'a' if you encounter one

**derniermotparams.c** => from a string in argv, print the last word (define by space)

**imprime_inverse.c** => print from the end to the beginning argv

**int_array_max.c** => find the highest value in a int array (length given)

**int_to_hex.c** && **int_to_hex_v2.c** => convert integer to hexadecimal

**intersection.c** => from the first param, check if you have the letter in the second param (print it) without double

**inversecase.c** => invert lowercase and uppercase

**miroirmoitie.c** => mirror alphabet from middle

**one_space_str.c** => keep only one space, remove the first and last one 

**premiermot.c** => keep the  first word of a tring (word definition => separated by space)

**premierparam.c** => print the first param 

**repetelettre.c** => from the string given repeat the letter equivalent of the index in the alphabet

**rot13.c**

**rotone.c** => rotation of one 

**stringrev.c** => reverse the string given 

**trouveetremplace.c** => in the given string (first arg), find the letter (second arg) and print the other letter (third arg)

**PuissanceDe2.c** => (used in a video on my channel) demonstrate a way to know if the input is a power of 2

**xor_swap.c** => (used in a video on my channel) demonstrate a way to swap values with xor

**SelectionSort.c** => selection sort algorithm

**exercice8_3** => exercice from internet using argc, argv

**BubbleSort.c** => implementation/demonstration of bubble sort algorithm

**BinarySearch** => example of binary search with comparison

**SortedArrayFusion** => fusion of 2 sorted array (dynamic memory)

**ProduitDeuxVecteur** => calculation with 2 arrays / vector

**itob.c** => (used in a video on my channel) demonstrate a way to print on stdout a byte (with the leading 0)

**LowerUpper.c** => (used in a video on my channel) demonstrate a way to change from lowercase/uppercase with bitwise operators

**turn.c** => (not used in the final version of a video on my channel) demonstrate a way to change nibbles order

**lecture.c** => (exercice from piscine42 - C10) using read/open/close/read/write print on stdout the content of a file

**main_printf_correction** => used for evaluation peer to peer of a project in 42 schools

**brainfuck.c** => (used in a video on my channel) small brainfuck interpreter (more a demo than a real one)

**powerset_like** => an exercise like powerset from leetcode but not totally with a little twist

**backtracking_parenthesis** => an exercise where I explore backtracking with parenthesis generation. Constraints are: should print only balanced solutions and with the minimum to remove (to avoid empty strings or too many solutions)

**filtre.c** => read from stdin and replace the needle by '*'
